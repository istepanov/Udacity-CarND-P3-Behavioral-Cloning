# Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Behavioral Cloning Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points

Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network (not part of this repo, [link to download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9eatljI4gpBdEY3SzRUV0FFZ2M))
* README.md summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code

**NOTE:** due to GitHub file size limits, the `model.h5` isn't tracked by git and can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9eatljI4gpBdEY3SzRUV0FFZ2M).

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/src -p 4567:4567 udacity/carnd-term1-starter-kit python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (model.py lines 18-24)

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 20), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 18).

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21).

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting.

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ...

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving (left, center and right cameras):

![](images/center1.jpg)

Also, there are images from letf and right cameras. During training, these images are being used together with central camera images, but with adjusted steering angle - we got 3 times more training data and the model learns better how to recover from off-center position.

![](images/left1.jpg)
![](images/right1.jpg)

To get even better recovering abilities, I've recorded the vehicle starting its movement from the left side and right sides of the road back to center:

![](images/center2.jpg)

On the image above, the vehicle is recovering from the right side of the road while being located next to the water surface - the model had hard time distinguishing road surface vs water surface on early stages of training (or maybe it just liked swimming better then driving ðŸ˜€):

![](images/fail1.png)

Then I repeated this process on track 2 in order to get more data points. Here's another example of a failed image recognition - the car thinks the road goes straight forward, althought it's just a background and the real road turns right:

![](images/fail2.png)

To fix this, I had to do additional recovery training on that particular spot of the road.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![](images/todo1.jpg)
![](images/todo2.jpg)

Total number of images:

* train samples: 14,765 (we can count it as 44,295 samples because every sample has 3 images from left, center, and right cameras)
* validation samples: 3,692 (random 20% of all samples, just central camera)

I used these training samples for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 30, because the validation loss stopped dropping at that point:

## Things to improve

1. On track 1 the car occasionally starts moving left and right instead of just staying in the middle of the road. It feels like even more training data could solve this problem.

2. On track 2 the car moves in the middle of the road, using the central line as a guide line, instead of using the left lane. I tried to train the model to stay on the left lane only, but because I randomly flipping training images, the model got confused about left and right lanes, that affected driving stability of the car. Looks like image flipping isn't a good idea for real world multi-lane traffic.
